Spring 4 MVC+AngularJS CRUD Application using ngResource
--------------------------------------------------------
This post demonstrates a full CRUD application using AngularJS ngResource module with $resource service to communicate with REST API on server. AngularJS ngResource module provides built-in support for interacting with RESTful services, via $resource service. $resource is a higher-level abstraction on low-level $http service used for server communication. If you have a RESTful API on your server, you can significantly reduce the amount of code you have to write to interact with server using AngularJS ngResource module.

We will create a CRUD application using Spring REST API on back-end while AngularJS encapsulated within plain JSP on front-end, using $resource service for server communication.


Want to download???
There are two downloads available with this post: One with only client part (pure javascript solution), other as a complete spring application. This gives you complete freedom on what to use.

If you want only client part, and you already have a REST API based server, just download client part, change the endpoint to your server end-point, and that’s it.
If you want to use client and servers separate, download and install them separately. This way, you can use pure javascript client while still interacting with Server from this POST.
Or just download the Complete application, and access home page using http://localhost:8080/Spring4MVCAngularJSNgResourceExample/
